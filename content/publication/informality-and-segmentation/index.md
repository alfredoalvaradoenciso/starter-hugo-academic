abstract: The academic debate about informality has discussed whether this implies a segmented labor market, a competitive one or a mixed of both. Recent research has employed various empirical models in order to validate those hypothesis.However, it has not been possible to correct several deficiencies such as the use of earning equation, exogenous specification of labor segments and endogeneity by self selection. The present paper correct this constrains by using a self selectionmodel with entry barriers to formalemployment. It is concluded that there is indeed a multi-segmented labor market and that about a third of informal workers are involuntary
