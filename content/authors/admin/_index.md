I am an economist for the Equitable Growth, Finance and Institutions (EFI) LAC office at the World Bank. My role primarily involves monitoring and ensuring the quality of analytical reports and lending operations. Additionally, I actively promote engagement in our projects aimed at fostering economic and inclusive growth. I have designed national policies, generated evidence for policymaking, and conducted media-impactful research. I also worked in the public sector in Peru in the areas of private sector development, labor, and education. Moreover, I worked at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), supporting the research agenda on labor and human capital issues and impact evaluation products.
