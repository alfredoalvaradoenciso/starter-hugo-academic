I am an economist for the Equitable Growth, Finance and Institutions (EFI) LAC Front Office at the World Bank. I am responsible for monitoring and ensuring the quality of analytical reports, papers and lending operations. I also maintain interactions with key stakeholders to promote engagement in our projects that aims to boost economic and inclusive growth. I have experience designing national policies, generating evidence for policymaking, and conducting media-impactful research. I worked as an economist in the public sector in Peru concerning private sector development, labor, and education. I also worked at the Inter-American Development Bank, supporting research agenda on labor and human capital issues and impact evaluation products for various countries.
